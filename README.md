Databases use NoSQL which consists of MongoDB and Mongoose.  
Twilio plugin is used for text alerts.

Handlebars.js is an extension to the Mustache templating language created by Chris Wanstrath. 
Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.
